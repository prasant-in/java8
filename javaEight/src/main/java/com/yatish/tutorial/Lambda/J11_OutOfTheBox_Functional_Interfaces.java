	 * Java 8 provides, few out of the box Functional Interfaces. Consider you are writing a lambda expression, for assigning it to a variable, you have to simply write a functional
	 * interface. So to avoid developer to write functional interfaces, java 8 itself provides few standard functional interfaces. the user can use them instead of writing a functional 
	 * interface based on the scenario.
	 * 
	 * The Standard Out of the Box Lambda expression are introduced in a new package in java 8 - 'java.util.function.*' package
